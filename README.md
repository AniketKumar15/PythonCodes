# 🐍 PythonCodes

**A collection of Python scripts and mini-projects created during my learning journey.**

## 📂 Project Structure

- **LearningCode/** – Experimental code snippets and practice exercises.
- **Project1/** –  Rock–Paper–Scissors.
- **Project2/** – Perfect Number Guesser.
- *(More folders → more fun!)*

## 🚀 What’s Inside

These scripts helped me build confidence with:
- Explain every code with the comments, So anyone can understand.
- Basic data types, loops, functions, and `input()` / `print()`
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Error handling using `try/except`
- Game logic, user interaction, and randomization
- Code structure and reuse through classes & modular files
